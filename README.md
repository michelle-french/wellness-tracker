This app is a health and wellness tracker. It provides a convenience to the logged-in user by offering the ability to keep track of appointments, medications, pain, food intake, 
exercise and/or mood. It will eliminate the need for having numerous apps such as one for appointments, another for logging exercise frequency and yet another for tracking 
moods. 
In order to eliminate the need to use multiple phone apps to log and track important medical information and gain the ability to conveniently access the information from any 
computer or phone, I chose to solve the issue with a multi-faceted wellness tracker app.
